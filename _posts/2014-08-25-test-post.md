<p>Drawing, like Piano, is something that I have spent exuberant amounts of money learning. However, in my ignorant childhood, I never practiced. Unlike piano, which became one of my central hobbies, all the resources poured into my drawing lessons were wasted. </p>
<p>I've never been great at showing expressions facially, so art interests me. This is especially true for digital art, where you can store yourself into an immortal canvas. I'm now self-studying art through online courses and tutorials with a heavy emphasis on practical experience. </p>
