<p>Students of Waterloo have an obsession for high resolution hallway photos, with me being no exception. (As shown above) I happened to have a seldom-used dslr camera lying around, so why not pick up a skill?  </p>
<p> I had ten days of free time after my first coop. I immediately took a Udemy course. It's impossible to learn from just watching minute-long videos, so for those ten days, I took my dslr everywhere and put the concepts into practice. While I'm still no expert, feel free to contact me for a portrait shot if you're nearby uWaterloo!</p>
