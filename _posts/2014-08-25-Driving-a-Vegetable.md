<p>Recently, I've reflected that for months at a time my mind is stuck in one of two states, which I call "vegetable" and "driven". Symptoms of the vegetable state include an inability to wake up, a constant feeling of having nothing to do, and the uncontrollable urge to waste spare time. The driven state entails always having awesome projects in mind, staying off traps such as online gaming and cheap fiction, getting proper sleep, and having the motivation to achieve greater results in school and in work. To maximize productivity, I'm in the process of researching how I enter and exit each state.  </p>
