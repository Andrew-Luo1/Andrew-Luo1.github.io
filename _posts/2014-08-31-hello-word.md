<p>Like too many Chinese who were raised abroad, I am illiterate in my home-spoken language. Ever since I stopped my childhood efforts to learn Chinese, I had given up on ever gaining the ability to read and write the language. I regretted this from time to time because of its beautiful novels and poetry and fascinating recipes.</p>
<p>For both personal and career reasons, I have decided to pick up the arduous task of learning Chinese. I aim to know 800 words by summer's end, and over 2000 by the early 2018!
